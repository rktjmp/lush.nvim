Lush ![CI](https://github.com/rktjmp/lush.nvim/workflows/CI/badge.svg)
====

Lush is a colorscheme creation aid for Neovim. It gives you real time
feedback as you edit, as well as color manipulation tools and some aids
building a structured colorscheme.

Lush colorschemes can easily be exported for use without Lush, either as
a lua table, vimscript commands or any other format. They can also be
imported into other Lua systems to access your color data.

See some colorschemes [**Made with Lush**](made_with_lush/README.md#made-with-lush).
